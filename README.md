The program prompts users to enter their login and password for sign up, and checks if the password is longer than 8 characters, has an uppercase character and a number. 

It then hashes the password using sha256 and stores it in a dictionary. 

For login, the program hashes the entered credentials and matches them with the stored passwords in the database (dictionary), and informs the user whether they have logged in successfully or not. 

LoginSimulator is a simple but effective way to simulate the login/sign up process and test the security of password storage in Python.
